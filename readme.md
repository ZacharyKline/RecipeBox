Recipe box is your favorite place to add delicious dishes which will thrill the whole family. Made in django!

Version 0.2 - Added forms to the recipe box.

Version 0.3 - Added a login authentication on Adding a recipe and an admin authentication on the add author page. I added a Login link on the homepage (though I didn't add a logout if user is logged in yet).
I also added an error page when you try to access the author add page without being an admin.

Admin users can edit all recipies.
Regular users can edit their own recipes.

Authors can favorite and unfavorite recipes.
A users favorites is linked through the user detail page.
